# Rate

This project was created to show my skills using .NET Core to deliver the rate between a pair of currencies.

## Problem

Write a .NET Core Console application that uses the contents of the XML file at https://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/eurofxref/eurofxref-daily.xml and expose an HTTP endpoint to retrieve the rate for a specific currency pair. So a GET request to http://localhost:port/rate?currencypair=GBPUSD should return the rate to convert GBP to USD. The rates should be cached for one hour so we donâ€™t download the file with every request.

## Installing

```
Clone the project
```

Open the solution file in Visual Studio 2017

Set LucasRosinelli.Rate.Api as your startup project and press "IIS Express" button. The API will run on

```
http://localhost:50635/
```

You can ignore the initial page.

To execute on browser, type on address bar:

```
http://localhost:50635/rate?currencyPair=GBPUSD
```

If you prefer, you can use Postman(https://www.getpostman.com/) to GET the rate. NOTE: cache feature will works only if "Send no-cache header" is disabled. For more information: (https://www.getpostman.com/docs/v6/postman/launching_postman/settings)

To create the executable file for Win-x64 / Windows 10 machine, go to LucasRosinelli.Rate.Presentation.Console folder in "Command Prompt" and type:

```
dotnet publish -c Release -r win10-x64
```
